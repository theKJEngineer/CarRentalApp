# 🚗 CarRentalApp - Vehicle Rental Management System

A Java application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage vehicle fleets, clients, and rental operations.

---

## 💡 Goal

To create a clean, architecturally sound system adhering to **OOP principles** (Inheritance, Polymorphism) and **SOLID** principles.

## 🏗️ Structure

The project follows standard Java package conventions, organized into three main layers:

* **`com.carrental.model`** (Includes `model.vehicle`): Core data entities and the vehicle inheritance hierarchy.
* **`com.carrental.manager`**: Main business logic and operational coordination (`RentalAgency`).
* **`com.carrental.util`**: Helper enums and utility classes.

## ▶️ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone ...`
2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA.**
3.  **Run:** Execute the `Main` class in the `com.carrental.app` package.
